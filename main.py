#TODO: IMPORTANT! Run cleanMessageDeque in a seperate thread!

#TODO: Bugcheck the vote execution/checking system.  It was finalized in a hurry

#TODO: Add a check to make sure the bot's rank is on top of the heiarchy

#TODO: When someone removes their reaction, remove their vote
#TODO: When someone votes, remove their other vote on the same prop (if it exists)
#TODO: Transition from messageId to uniqueId
#TODO: Add time delays for actions (adjustable by admin)
#TODO: Add other commands such as status/remove/helpâœ“/about
#TODO: Status logs should De activate their respective props when deleted, and revert when edited. (use on_delete_message and on_edit_message)

# Oh Boi.  DiscordPY stores all messages that it receives in a deque.  
# This deque is stored in memory and has a default cap of 5000 messages.
# When the bot (process) shutsdown, this deque is cleared, and the bot looses all ability to
# reference any messages that were in it.  The worst part is that the on_reaction_add event is ONLY TRIGGERED
# FOR MESSAGES ON THE DEQUE.  My current solution consists of going through the entire deque regularily and cleaning it of
# non-prop messages.  When it does hit a prop message, it stores it in a new table on the DB where it will be backed up.
# If the bot has a crash/shutdown/update, the props will be restored in the deque when the bot starts back up.
# Luckily the deque and the client object are mutable, which means I can pass the client class into both the store loop and start it's task
# in the event loop.  As long as I use non-assignment operators in storeLoop, the changes I make to the deque should carry over.
